# ![NoAutoTreeCut](./About/Preview.png)

WARNING: ALPHA VERSION, NOT FULLY TESTED!

Prevent your pawns automatically cutting trees and uproot them instead!

**Commissioned in the RimWorld Mod Market**

## Features

Replaces tree cutting jobs with extract jobs when a tree blocks building, roofing, or farming.

This behaviour can be changed using the provided mod settings.

## Future Plans

I plan to add support for automatically switching the behaviour based on pawn views / ideoligion
and adjusting the available settings to switch the extraction behaviour between OFF, AUTO, and ON.

## Existing Saves

DISREGARD THIS FOR ALPHA VERSION

This mod should be safe to add or remove from saves.
